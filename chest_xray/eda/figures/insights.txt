📌 KEY INSIGHTS:

1. SEVERE CLASS IMBALANCE
   - "No Finding" dominates with 53.8% of images
   - Hernia is extremely rare (0.2%, only 227 cases)
   - Imbalance ratio: ~266:1 between largest and smallest class
   → Recommendation: Use weighted loss, oversampling, or focal loss

2. MULTI-LABEL NATURE
   - 18.5% of images have multiple diseases
   - Up to 9 diseases can co-occur in single image
   - Infiltration frequently co-occurs with other diseases
   → Recommendation: Use multi-label BCE loss, not softmax

3. DISEASE CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS
   - Infiltration + Effusion: Most common combination
   - Atelectasis often appears with Effusion
   - Emphysema + Pneumothorax show high co-occurrence
   → Insight: Consider disease relationships in model design

4. DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS
   - Slight male predominance (56.5%)
   - Mean age ~47 years, mostly middle-aged adults
   - Some diseases show clear gender differences
   → Consideration: Demographics could be useful features

5. LIMITED LOCALIZATION DATA
   - Only 984 bounding boxes (<1% coverage)
   - Only 8 disease classes have annotations
   → Conclusion: Not suitable for object detection (YOLO)

6. TRAIN/TEST SPLIT
   - 77% train, 23% test (pre-defined)
   - Similar class distributions in both splits
   → Use provided split for fair comparison with literature

🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
   - Model: DenseNet-121 or ConvNeXt
   - Loss: Weighted BCE or Focal Loss
   - Output: Sigmoid (not softmax) for multi-label
   - Metric: AUC-ROC (industry standard for this dataset)
   - Handle imbalance: Class weights + data augmentation
